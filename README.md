## :closed_lock_with_key: The Password Strength Theory
Here is a comic that summarizes the theory behind the password generation. When you think of a secure password, you may think of a string of random characters (e.g. Mdw*24j__920). Sounds hard to memorize right? It is. 

Instead, you could just have a string of random common words like "Correct Horse Battery Staple". Passwords like these can be even more secure than strings of random characters, and are infinitely more memorable!
